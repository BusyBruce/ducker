# ðŸ¦† Ducker

Small docker image with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and [PRQL](https://www.prql-lang.org/) included!

## Quickstart

```bash
alias dckr='docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/data -w /data duckerlabs/ducker'
```
then `dckr` gives you a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shell with [PRQL](https://www.prql-lang.org/) enabled!

For example, to get the first 5 lines of a csv file named "albums.csv", you could run
```bash
dckr -c 'from `albums.csv` | take 5;'
```
